## Database Design

The database architecture consists of several key entities that model the core functionality of the Airbnb platform:

### User Entity
- **Fields**: user_id (Primary Key), email, password_hash, first_name, last_name, phone_number, profile_picture, created_at, updated_at
- **Relationships**: One-to-many with Properties (as host), one-to-many with Bookings (as guest), one-to-many with Reviews

### Property Entity
- **Fields**: property_id (Primary Key), host_id (Foreign Key), title, description, address, city, country, price_per_night, property_type, amenities, created_at
- **Relationships**: Many-to-one with User (host), one-to-many with Bookings, one-to-many with Reviews

### Booking Entity
- **Fields**: booking_id (Primary Key), property_id (Foreign Key), guest_id (Foreign Key), check_in_date, check_out_date, total_price, booking_status, created_at
- **Relationships**: Many-to-one with Property, many-to-one with User (guest), one-to-one with Payment

### Review Entity
- **Fields**: review_id (Primary Key), property_id (Foreign Key), user_id (Foreign Key), rating, comment, created_at
- **Relationships**: Many-to-one with Property, many-to-one with User

### Payment Entity
- **Fields**: payment_id (Primary Key), booking_id (Foreign Key), amount, payment_method, payment_status, transaction_id, created_at
- **Relationships**: One-to-one with Booking

### Entity Relationships
- Users can be both hosts (owning multiple properties) and guests (making multiple bookings)
- Each property belongs to one host but can have multiple bookings and reviews
- Bookings connect guests with properties for specific date ranges
- Reviews are linked to both the property and the reviewing user
- Payments are directly tied to bookings for transaction tracking

## Feature Breakdown

### User Management System
A comprehensive authentication and profile management system that handles user registration, login, and profile customization. This feature enables users to create accounts, manage their personal information, and switch between host and guest roles seamlessly.

### Property Management
A robust system for hosts to list, edit, and manage their properties including photo uploads, amenity listings, and pricing strategies. This feature provides hosts with tools to create attractive listings that effectively showcase their properties to potential guests.

### Search and Filtering System
An advanced search engine that allows guests to find properties based on location, dates, price range, amenities, and property type. This feature enhances user experience by helping guests quickly discover properties that match their specific requirements and preferences.

### Booking System
A secure and intuitive booking workflow that handles date availability, pricing calculations, and reservation confirmations. This core feature manages the entire booking lifecycle from initial reservation through check-in, ensuring smooth transactions between hosts and guests.

### Payment Integration
A secure payment processing system that handles transactions, refunds, and payout management for hosts. This feature integrates with payment gateways to ensure safe financial transactions while providing transparent fee structures and automated payment distribution.

### Review and Rating System
A dual-sided review system allowing both hosts and guests to rate and review each other after completed stays. This feature builds trust within the platform community by promoting transparency and accountability through authentic user feedback.

### Communication System
An integrated messaging platform that enables secure communication between hosts and guests before, during, and after bookings. This feature facilitates coordination for check-ins, house rules clarification, and support requests while maintaining user privacy.

## API Security

### Authentication and Authorization
Implementation of JWT-based authentication ensures secure user sessions and API access control. Multi-factor authentication adds an extra security layer for sensitive operations like payments and account modifications, protecting user accounts from unauthorized access.

### Data Protection and Encryption
All sensitive data including passwords, payment information, and personal details are encrypted both in transit and at rest. HTTPS encryption secures all API communications, while database-level encryption protects stored user information from potential security breaches.

### Rate Limiting and API Protection
Implementation of rate limiting prevents API abuse and protects against DDoS attacks, ensuring platform stability and fair resource usage. Input validation and sanitization protect against injection attacks and malicious data manipulation attempts.

### Security Importance by Area
- **User Data Protection**: Critical for maintaining user trust and complying with privacy regulations like GDPR
- **Payment Security**: Essential for preventing financial fraud and ensuring secure monetary transactions
- **Property Data Integrity**: Important for preventing fake listings and maintaining platform credibility
- **Communication Security**: Necessary for protecting private conversations between hosts and guests

## CI/CD Pipeline

### Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment Overview
CI/CD pipelines are automated workflows that streamline the software development lifecycle by automatically building, testing, and deploying code changes. These pipelines are crucial for maintaining code quality, reducing deployment errors, and enabling rapid feature delivery while ensuring system stability.

### Pipeline Stages and Benefits
The CI/CD pipeline automatically triggers when code is pushed to the repository, running comprehensive tests including unit tests, integration tests, and security scans. Upon successful testing, the pipeline builds Docker containers and deploys them to staging environments for final validation before production release.

### Tools and Technologies
- **GitHub Actions**: Primary CI/CD platform for automating build, test, and deployment workflows
- **Docker**: Containerization for consistent deployment environments across development, staging, and production
- **Jest and PyTest**: Automated testing frameworks for frontend and backend code validation
- **SonarQube**: Code quality analysis and security vulnerability scanning
- **AWS CodeDeploy**: Automated deployment to cloud infrastructure with rollback capabilities

### Pipeline Importance
CI/CD pipelines significantly reduce manual deployment errors, accelerate feature delivery, and ensure consistent code quality standards. They enable the team to deploy multiple updates daily while maintaining system reliability and quick rollback capabilities in case of issues.
